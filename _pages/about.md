I am an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago, double majoring in Statistics and Psychology. I am a research assistant in the [Motivation and Cognition Neuroscience Lab](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/) working with [Dr. Yuan Chang Leong](https://ycleong.github.io/).

I am interested in using neurocomputational approach, for example fNIRS or fMRI, to study how people perceive and interpret social situations and if any interventions could help control the idiosyncrasy in how social information is processed.
